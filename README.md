# OAI Chat VS Code Extension

This extension brings a Copilot Chat-like experience to VS Code, powered by Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Search. Chat with AI, search your enterprise data, and provide file contextâ€”all in a modern chat panel.

## Features

- Chat panel UI inspired by GitHub Copilot Chat
- Query Azure AI Search and Azure OpenAI in a single workflow
- Attach files to provide additional context to the AI
- Modern chat bubbles and message history
- Easily configure endpoints and keys from the panel

## Requirements

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

- `azureAIChat.openAIApiEndpoint`: Azure OpenAI API endpoint URL
- `azureAIChat.openAIApiKey`: Azure OpenAI API key
- `azureAIChat.searchApiEndpoint`: Azure AI Search endpoint URL
- `azureAIChat.searchApiKey`: Azure AI Search API key

You can also edit these settings directly in the chat panel.

## Usage

1. Open the command palette and run `Open OAI Chat Panel`.
2. Configure your Azure endpoints and keys in the panel.
3. Type your question and optionally attach a file for more context.
